# IMDB
I created a program which scrape data from IMDB

This is a sample program which Scrapes data from IMDB site.

Prerequisite : Basic knowledge of Python, HTML, and few hours with beautifulSoup. (Optional: Brain)

Since there are only 4 urls, so I initialized with those urls. (String manupulations can be used for more similar urls)

Resultant Dataframe can be stored using pd.to_csv("NewFileName.csv") # or any other supported format.
